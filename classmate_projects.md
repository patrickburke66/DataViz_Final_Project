Today I talked with Kassandra about our projects. She plans on making a Shiny app about Olympic Swimming data, and all the different variables you can change within it. It is interesting because there are hundreds of different combinations for her data. Different lengths of competition (50m, 100m, 200m, etc...), different strokes, differing team events (relay vs. individual), as well as seeing how this has all changed over time.

Talked with Dr. Higham about my project as we had an odd number of students in class.

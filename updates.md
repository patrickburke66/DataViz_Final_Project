## March 21

Today we initiated our projects. I am still deciding between a Mariokart Character Builder Shiny app and a Shiny app showing the impact of spin-rates on MLB Pitches. I spent time scraping the Mariokart wiki to get the statistics for each Kart, Wheel, and Character. I still need to scrape to gather the data for the Gliders, as well as the "Hidden Statistics." These are the statistics which aren't visible while in the game, but are in the game's code.

### Beginning of Class

Got all of the data in and began to create an idea for a shiny app, as well as trying to combine the data sets. 

### End of Class

Edited my data to begin to make the static table, which I want showing up as a reactive table in my shiny app. I also brainstormed other ideas to include in my final project, such as graphs to show and presenting the tracks which the chosen combination is optimized for. My goal is to be able to show some sort of reactive table by in time for class on Monday, 3/28.

## March 29

This push is coming a day late as I was sick for class on the 28th. I have worked on my project to get the reactive table to display. I am still working and attempting to better format this table as well as try to add a reactive graph into my app. At the moment the table works exactly how I want it to apart from the fact it does not display the column names for each variable.

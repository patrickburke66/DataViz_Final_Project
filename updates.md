## March 21

Today we initiated our projects. I am still deciding between a Mariokart Character Builder Shiny app and a Shiny app showing the impact of spin-rates on MLB Pitches. I spent time scraping the Mariokart wiki to get the statistics for each Kart, Wheel, and Character. I still need to scrape to gather the data for the Gliders, as well as the "Hidden Statistics." These are the statistics which aren't visible while in the game, but are in the game's code.
